### Project Description and Vision
**Description**: Introduced in Calculus I, derivates represent the instanteaneous rate-of-change of a function at a given point (x, f(x)). These can be easy to derive and calculate with linear and polynomial functions, but it can get overwhelming at times with the various rules. However, this library is an in-progress way to get both the derivative displayed and calculate that value at given point (x, f(x)).

**Vision**: This library will be able to ingest a string representation of a function, calculate the derivative, and then compute the value of the derivative at (x, f(x)). The user will be able to do the following actions:
- Ingest a string of a function, and then print the derivative of given function to the user.
- Ingest a string of a function, derive it, then calculate the rate-of-change at point (x, f(x))
- Estimate the derivative by using point-slope form.
